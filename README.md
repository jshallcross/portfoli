Web Developer Portfolio

This was the week 2 challenge from the University of Toronto School of Continued Studies Coding Boot Camp. This portfolio shows how far I came from week 2 until the React portfolio I created in week 20. The requirements had us use HTML, CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grids. I received a mark of 98%.
